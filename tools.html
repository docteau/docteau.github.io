		<h3>PRIMO</h3>
		<p>Despite the many techniques devised to increase the precision of 
		static analysis results, the results precision is often not high 
		enough for large scale analysis. This is because the static inference 
		of many properties is undecidable, and others are too computationally 
		expensive. This is especially problematic with the rise of centralized 
		application markets, where market providers may want to verify 
		properties (e.g., security) in their entire corpus. In this case 
		imprecise results are not acceptable.
		</p>

		<p>We explore the use of probabilistic models in order to help sift 
		through large numbers of results and prioritize them by decreasing 
		order of likelihood. We apply this to the computation of links between 
		over 10,000 Android applications with our PRIMO tool. PRIMO is able to 
		compute links between various applications as computed by IC3 (see 
		below). It can also compute the probability that these links are true 
		positives.
		</p>

		<h3>COAL</h3>
		<p>Many program analyses require statically inferring the possible 
		values of object variables. However, current approaches either do not 
		account for correlations between object fields or do so in an ad hoc 
		manner. The COAL project enables the specification and solution of 
		these problems in a principled way. The project includes a language 
		that is used to describe the classes of the objects whose value should 
		be inferred. It also includes a solver, which computes the object 
		values.
		</p>

		<p>The COAL language allows easy specification of composite constant 
		propagation problems. Our COAL solver takes as inputs a COAL 
		specification and the code that needs to be analyzed and automatically 
		outputs the value of the fields of the requested variables. Note that 
		in programs where there are several possible values for a given object, 
		the COAL solver infers all possible values, taking into account the 
		correlations between the fields on different execution paths.
		</p>

		<h3>IC3</h3>
		<p>Many threats present in smartphones are the result of interactions 
		between application components, not just artifacts of single 
		components. For example, information may flow between components in an 
		unsafe manner. A component in an application may retrieve a user's 
		location data or contacts. It may subsequently send the sensitive 
		private information to a component in another application. The 
		receiving component may then leak the sensitive information to the 
		network, to an untrusted third party.
		</p>

		<p>Using COAL, we build IC3, a tool for inferring ICC with 
		significantly better precision than Epicc. Unlike Epicc, it models all 
		ICC primitives.
		</p>

		<p>For information about IC3, please visit 
		<a href="http://siis.cse.psu.edu/ic3/">siis.cse.psu.edu/ic3</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Epicc</h3>
		<p>Epicc was our initial tool for inferring ICC in Android 
		applications. It paved the way for the idea of reducing the inference 
		of object values to an Interprocedural Distributive Environment (IDE) 
		data flow problem.
		 </p>

		<h3>Dare</h3>
<p>Dare is a tool that retargets Android applications running on the Dalvik 
Virtual Machine to traditional Java Virtual Machine .class files. These .class files can then be 
processed by existing Java tools, including decompilers. Thus, Android 
applications can be analyzed using a vast range of techniques developed for 
traditional Java applications. Dare replaces ded as a retargeting tool: it 
is more accurate, more efficient, more powerful and can even handle cases 
where the input code is unverifiable.
</p>

<p>Dare was awarded the Best Artifact Award at the 20th International Symposium 
on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE), recognizing its value as a 
significant and high-quality tool. For more information, you can read the 
paper "Retargeting Android Applications to Java Bytecode" by Octeau et al., 
published in the proceedings of the 20th International Symposium on the 
Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE). For downloads, see the 
<a href="http://siis.cse.psu.edu/dare/">Dare page</a>.

<h3>ded</h3>
<p>Smartphone applications are frequently incompletely vetted, poorly isolated, 
and installed by users without restraint. Smartphone research frequently needs 
to understand how these applications behave. ded is a project which aims at 
decompiling Android applications. The ded tool retargets Android applications 
in .dex format to traditional .class files. These .class files can then be 
processed by existing Java tools, including decompilers. Thus, Android 
applications can be analyzed using a vast range of techniques developed for 
traditional Java applications.
