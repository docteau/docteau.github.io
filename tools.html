		<h3>Epicc</h3>
		<p>Many threats present in smartphones are the result of interactions 
		between application components, not just artifacts of single 
		components. For example, information may flow between components in an 
		unsafe manner. A component in an application may retrieve a user's 
		location data or contacts. It may subsequently send the sensitive 
		private information to a component in another application. The 
		receiving component may then leak the sensitive information to the 
		network, to an untrusted third party.
		</p>
		
		<p>We reduce the discovery of ICC to an instance of the Interprocedural
		 Distributive Environment (IDE) data flow problem. This approach is 
		 very accurate, conservatively keeping track of multiple execution 
		 branches. It is path-sensitive, flow-sensitive, inter-procedural and 
		 context-sensitive. Our implementation of this approach is called Epicc 
		 (Effective and Precise ICC). It scales well, taking on average less 
		 than two minutes per application in a large scale study of 1,200 
		 applications. Epicc uses Java classes as input, which can be generated 
		 from Android bytecode using our Dare retargeting tool.
		 </p>

		<h3>Dare</h3>
<p>Dare is a tool that retargets Android applications running on the Dalvik 
Virtual Machine to traditional Java Virtual Machine .class files. These .class files can then be 
processed by existing Java tools, including decompilers. Thus, Android 
applications can be analyzed using a vast range of techniques developed for 
traditional Java applications. Dare replaces ded as a retargeting tool: it 
is more accurate, more efficient, more powerful and can even handle cases 
where the input code is unverifiable.
</p>

<p>Dare was awarded the Best Artifact Award at the 20th International Symposium 
on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE), recognizing its value as a 
significant and high-quality tool. For more information, you can read the 
paper "Retargeting Android Applications to Java Bytecode" by Octeau et al., 
published in the proceedings of the 20th International Symposium on the 
Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE). For downloads, see the 
<a href="http://siis.cse.psu.edu/dare/">Dare page</a>.

<h3>ded</h3>
<p>Smartphone applications are frequently incompletely vetted, poorly isolated, 
and installed by users without restraint. Smartphone research frequently needs 
to understand how these applications behave. ded is a project which aims at 
decompiling Android applications. The ded tool retargets Android applications 
in .dex format to traditional .class files. These .class files can then be 
processed by existing Java tools, including decompilers. Thus, Android 
applications can be analyzed using a vast range of techniques developed for 
traditional Java applications.
