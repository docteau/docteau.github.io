		<h2>Retargeting Mobile Applications to Java Bytecode</h2>

<p class="text">
Android applications are developed in Java but compiled to a platform-specific 
Dalvik bytecode. Dalvik bytecode runs in a Dalvik virtual machine, which was 
designed for resource-constrained platforms such as smartphones and tablets. 
Since existing analysis frameworks target Java source code and bytecode, it is 
necessary to convert Android applications to these well-known Java formats.
</p>

<p class="text">
ded is a project which aims at decompiling Android applications. The ded 
tool retargets Android applications in .dex format to traditional .class 
files. These .class files can then be processed by existing Java tools, 
including decompilers. Thus, Android applications can be analyzed using a 
vast range of techniques developed for traditional Java applications. 
</p>

<p class="text">
ded was the first tool that was able to reliably convert Android applications 
to source code. It was used in a seminal large scale 
analysis of Android applications. We decompiled the 1,100 
most popular applications using 
ded. The decompiled code was then analyzed using Fortify Source Code 
Analyzer (SCA). We implemented Android-specific detection rules in Fortify SCA. 
While this analysis did not reveal any malware, we found that phone 
identifiers and other personally identifiable information were widely used 
by Android applications.

 <p class="text">
On the other hand, the Dare tool adopts a principled approach to Dalvik 
retargeting. Its typed intermediate representation uses a strong type 
inference algorithm and allows translation to Java bytecode using only 9 
rules for all 257 Dalvik opcodes. An important feature of Dare is 
its ability to rewrite unverifiable input bytecode so that the output Java 
bytecode is verifiable. In particular, the use of 
stronger methods makes it a better retargeting tool than 
ded, our first (ad hoc) retargeting 
tool. Dare is more reliable at retargeting Android bytecode and generates 
verifiable 
Java bytecode in a vast majority of cases. 
In order to enable the analysis of retargeted Android code by other 
researchers, we have made Dare available for download. Both binaries and 
source code are available from the <a href="http://siis.cse.psu.edu/dare/">Dare webpage</a>.

		<h2>Composite Constant Propagation and its Application to Program 
		Analysis for Security</h2>
		<p>Many threats present in smartphones are the result of interactions 
		between application components, not just artifacts of single 
		components. For example, information may flow between components in an 
		unsafe manner. A component in an application may retrieve a user's 
		location data or contacts. It may subsequently send the sensitive 
		private information to a component in another application. The 
		receiving component may then leak the sensitive information to the 
		network, to an untrusted third party.
		</p>

		<p>We reduce the discovery of ICC to an instance of the Interprocedural
		Distributive Environment (IDE) data flow problem. This approach is 
		very accurate, conservatively keeping track of multiple execution 
		branches. It is path-sensitive, flow-sensitive, inter-procedural and 
		context-sensitive. Our implementation of this approach is called Epicc 
		(Effective and Precise ICC). It scales well, taking on average less 
		than two minutes per application in a large scale study of 1,200 
		applications. Epicc uses Java classes as input, which can be generated 
		from Android bytecode using our Dare retargeting tool.

		</center>

		<p>While Epicc is a significant improvement over state-of-the-art 
		approaches, it is still limited in coverage, due to the difficulty of 
		individually specifying data domains and transfer functions. Thus, we 
		generalize the problem of inferring values of objects with composite 
		types as composite constant propagation problems. We introduce the 
		COAL language to specify composite constant propagation problems and 
		implement a solver that automatically generates data domains and 
		transfer functions. Solutions are then found using existing algorithms, 
		requiring minimal intervention from the analyst.
		</p>

		<p>Using COAL, we build IC3, a tool for inferring ICC with 
		significantly better precision than Epicc. Unlike Epicc, it models all 
		ICC primitives. IC3 itself is used as the basis of inter-component 
		information flow analysis in the related IccTA tool. COAL was also used 
		with success to resolve reflection in Android applications.

		<h2>Combining Static Analysis Results with Probabilistic Models</h2>
		<p>Despite the many techniques devised to increase the precision of 
		static analysis results, the results precision is often not high 
		enough for large scale analysis. This is because the static inference 
		of many properties is undecidable, and others are too computationally 
		expensive. This is especially problematic with the rise of centralized 
		application markets, where market providers may want to verify 
		properties (e.g., security) in their entire corpus. In this case 
		imprecise results are not acceptable.
		</p>

		<p>We explore the use of probabilistic models in order to help sift 
		through large numbers of results and prioritize them by decreasing 
		order of likelihood. We apply this to the computation of links between 
		over 10,000 Android applications with our PRIMO tool. We find that 
		probabilistic models are an effective and accurate way to predict 
		which links computed with static analysis are most likely to be false 
		positives.
