		<h2>Epicc: Inferring Inter-Component Communication in mobile applications</h2>
		<p>Many threats present in smartphones are the result of interactions 
		between application components, not just artifacts of single 
		components. For example, information may flow between components in an 
		unsafe manner. A component in an application may retrieve a user's 
		location data or contacts. It may subsequently send the sensitive 
		private information to a component in another application. The 
		receiving component may then leak the sensitive information to the 
		network, to an untrusted third party.
		</p>

		<p>
		However, current techniques for identifying inter-component communication (ICC) 
		are ad hoc and do not scale to large numbers of applications. That is why we 
		developed an approach to statically study ICC that is both precise and highly 
		scalable. Further, it is defined using formalisms already widely studied by 
		the program analysis community.
		</p>

		</center>

		<p>We reduce the discovery of ICC to an instance of the Interprocedural
		Distributive Environment (IDE) data flow problem. This approach is 
		very accurate, conservatively keeping track of multiple execution 
		branches. It is path-sensitive, flow-sensitive, inter-procedural and 
		context-sensitive. Our implementation of this approach is called Epicc 
		(Effective and Precise ICC). It scales well, taking on average less 
		than two minutes per application in a large scale study of 1,200 
		applications. Epicc uses Java classes as input, which can be generated 
		from Android bytecode using our Dare retargeting tool.
		</p>

		<p>
		Our tool is built on top of 
		<a href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/">Soot</a> and uses the 
		<a href="https://github.com/Sable/heros">Heros</a> IDE solver. This allows 
		us to leverage many analyses that are part of Soot (aliasing analysis, call 
		graph construction, etc.) and to obtain solutions to IDE data flow problem 
		efficiently. Combined with our formally-defined IDE reduction, 
		this enables us to obtain precise results when applying Epicc to vulnerability 
		detection.
		Epicc is indeed more precise than previously 
		released ICC tools. Further, other tools related to ICC have looked at 
		vulnerabilities of component entry points and exit points, whereas Epicc seeks 
		to effectively connect components that may communicate with each other.

<h2>Dare: Dalvik Retargeting</h2>
 <p>
Dare is a project which aims at enabling Android application analysis. The Dare 
tool retargets Android applications in .dex or .apk format to traditional 
.class files. These .class files can then be processed by existing Java tools, 
including decompilers. Thus, Android applications can be analyzed using a 
vast range of techniques developed for traditional Java applications.
</p>

  </div>
</center>

<p>
Dare adopts a principled approach to Dalvik 
retargeting. Its typed intermediate representation uses a strong type 
inference algorithm and allows translation to Java bytecode using only 9 
rules for all 257 Dalvik opcodes. An important feature of Dare is 
its ability to rewrite unverifiable input bytecode so that the output Java 
bytecode is verifiable. In particular, the use of 
stronger methods makes it a better retargeting tool than 
ded, our first (ad hoc) retargeting 
tool. Dare is more reliable at retargeting Android bytecode and generates 
verifiable 
Java bytecode in a vast majority of cases. 
In order to enable the analysis of retargeted Android code by other 
researchers, we have made Dare available for download. Both binaries and 
source code are available from the <a href="http://siis.cse.psu.edu/dare/">Dare webpage</a>.

<h2>ded: Decompiling Android Applications</h2>

<p class="text">
Smartphone applications are frequently incompletely vetted, poorly isolated, 
and installed by users without restraint. Such behavior is fraught with peril: 
applications containing malicious logic or critical vulnerabilities are 
likely to be identified only after substantial damage has already occurred. 
Unfortunately, the limitations of application markets make them a poor agent 
for certifying that applications are secure. 
</p>

<p class="text">
Android applications are developed in Java but compiled to a platform-specific 
Dalvik bytecode. Dalvik bytecode runs in a Dalvik virtual machine, which was 
designed for resource-constrained platforms such as smartphones and tablets. 
Since existing analysis frameworks target Java source code and bytecode, it is 
necessary to convert Android applications to these well-known Java formats.

We used our decompilation techniques to perform a large scale 
analysis of Android applications. We decompiled the 1,100 
most popular applications using 
ded. The decompiled code was then analyzed using Fortify Source Code 
Analyzer (SCA). We implemented Android-specific detection rules in Fortify SCA. 
While this analysis did not reveal any malware, we found that phone 
identifiers and other personally identifiable information were widely used 
by Android applications.
